    <h4> N Seoul Tower (SK) </h4>
    <p align="justify">
        "N Seoul Tower" in South Korea is my favorite tourist spot. 
        The N SEOUL TOWER, which is a symbol of Seoul now, was established 
        at the highest point to glance at the most beautiful images of Seoul. 
        It is also Korea's first general radio wave tower from 1969, delivering TV 
        and radio broadcasting in the metropolitan area.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h4> Samgeopsal (Korean BBQ) </h4>
    <p align="justify">
        "Samgyeopsal" is one of my favorite food. Samgyeopsal is a popular Korean dish 
        that is commonly served as an evening meal. The meat, usually either marinated 
        or seasoned, is cooked on a grill at the diner's table. Usually, diners grill 
        the meat themselves and eat directly from a grill. It is typically served with 
        ssamjang, vegetables, and lettuce leaves to wrap it in.
    </p>

    <div class="square">
        <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3"> 
    </div>

    <h4> Lemonade Mouth (2011) </h4>
    <p align="justify"> 
        One of my favorite movie and the one that I will never forget is "Lemonade Mouth (2011)".
        Since I'm into music, this movie was very interesting. The film tells the story of five high 
        school students who meet in detention and form a band to stand up for their beliefs and to 
        overcome their individual and collective struggles.
    </p>

    <div class="square">
        <img src="image4.jpg" alt="Image 4"> 
    </div>

    <h4> MAMAMOO (Korean Girl Group) </h4>
    <p align="justify">
        The one I like the most among all the girl groups that exist today is "MAMAMOO". They are so 
        very talented and interesting to listen to. MAMAMOO is a South Korean girl group formed by RBW (formerly WA Entertainment)
        in 2014, composed of four members: Solar, Moonbyul, Wheein and Hwasa.Their debut was considered by some critics as 
        one of the best K-pop debuts of 2014. They are recognized for their retro, jazz, R&B concepts 
        and their strong vocal performances.

    <h4> Morong Beach </h4>
    <p align="justify">
        One of my favorite landmark locally is Morong, Beach in Sabang, Batanes.
        Perfectly captivates the origins of Sabtang Island, with its white-sand 
        beach and calm atmosphere. Truth be told, it is hard not to long for a quick
        nap while looking at the clear blue water and listening to the soft humming of birds.
        Further, nestled across Morong Beach and the famous Ahaw Arch is a local eatery serving
        authentic Ivatan dishes, called Paypanapanayan Canteen.

    <h4> Stilts Beach </h4>
    <p align="justify">
        Another travel experience is in Stilts Beach in Calatagan, Batangas. 
        It has fair sand and shallow waters, and it is not as crowded as other beach destinations in the province.
    </p>

    <div class="square">
        <img src="palawan.jpg" alt="Batanes"> 
    </div>

    <h4> Coron Island </h4>
    <p align="justify">
        Last is in Coron, Palawan. Coron is a tropical island in the province of Palawan in the Philippines.
        It is best known for world-class World War II-era wreck diving, but the island also offers limestone karst 
        landscapes, beautiful Palawan beaches, crystal-clear freshwater lakes, and shallow-water coral reefs.
